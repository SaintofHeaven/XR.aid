## Project: Emergency Medical Response XR Tool for Snapchat Spectacles 5.0
This project is a cutting-edge Extended Reality (XR) application designed for the Snapchat Spectacles 5.0, aimed at revolutionizing emergency medical response for laypeople. The tool provides real-time, step-by-step guidance for performing critical medical procedures, enabling users to assist in emergency situations without any prior medical experience.

## Key Features

### Intuitive Visual Guidance:
The tool offers an overlay of 3D visual demonstrations directly onto the user's field of view. These animations guide the user through life-saving procedures, such as CPR, the Heimlich maneuver, and basic wound care.

### Integrated Communication with 911 Operators:
Users can initiate live video calls with 911 emergency operators. This connection not only allows operators to observe the situation but also provides real-time advice and guidance.
Audio and visual communication are fully integrated, including optional live captions for accessibility.

### Live Captioning for Accessibility:
Real-time captions ensure that users with hearing impairments can still receive critical instructions and communicate effectively with emergency operators.

### Automatic Operator Notification and Data Sharing:
Upon activation, the tool can automatically transmit location data and other critical information to 911 operators, ensuring timely dispatch of emergency services.
Purpose and Vision

The goal of this project is to empower everyday individuals to respond effectively to medical emergencies using an intuitive, augmented reality experience. By leveraging the capabilities of Snapchat Spectacles 5.0, this tool brings advanced medical response capabilities to anyone, anywhere, in a matter of seconds.
